# Thoughtful AI Customer Support Agent

A Streamlit-based customer support AI agent specifically designed for Thoughtful AI. This application provides an interactive chat interface that combines predefined knowledge base responses with AI-powered fallback capabilities using OpenAI's API.

## Features

- **AI Fallback**: OpenAI-powered responses for questions outside the knowledge base
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly Streamlit chat interface with conversation history
- **Confidence Scoring**: Visual indicators showing response source and confidence levels
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and API failures

## Healthcare Automation Agents

The agent can answer questions about Thoughtful AI's specialized healthcare automation agents:

- **EVA (Eligibility Verification Agent)**: Automates patient eligibility and benefits verification
- **CAM (Claims Processing Agent)**: Streamlines claims submission and management

## Architecture

The application follows a modular three-layer architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer** (`app.py`): Streamlit web interface
2. **Business Logic Layer** (`ai_agent.py`): Message processing and response orchestration
3. **Data Layer** (`knowledge_base.py`): Knowledge base management with fuzzy matching

## Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for AI fallback functionality (optional but recommended)

## Sample Questions

Try asking about:
- "What does EVA do?"
- "What does CAM do?"
- "How does PHIL work?"
- "Tell me about Thoughtful AI's Agents"
- "What are the benefits of using Thoughtful AI's agents?"
